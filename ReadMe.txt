This is Our Graduation Project about Smart Home.
Simply It consists of
1- 5 lamps for rooms,
2- dc motor acting as Air_Condtioning System
3- Servo motor acting as a automatic door
4- Temperature Sensor 
5- Dimmer for changing lamp intensity


To get in more details, This system operats on a Admin and User mode.
As an admin, Admin Contacts and sends messages to the system by a mobile (replaced with the virtual terminal in Simulation).
Admin can do whatever he likes in the system. with a feature of creating users.
Although This system carries only one user, we wanted to be concise and concentrated in all results showing in most of the devices used.
As a User, You can access whatever you want instead that you can't open the door and close it.
User only uses keypad and showing the results in the display screen.

This is brief explanation of the project and how it should be used.
